# Arduino Data Glasses for Multimeter 
## Description
This is actually a data glass model for the multimeter that has Bluetooth connectivity within it. Now, the role of the Arduino here is to use a Bluetooth module either HC-05/06, and connect it with the multimeter. Once it is connected, then the data from the multimeter (be it any reading) is transmitted over Bluetooth to Arduino, further then we use an OLED Screen to print the reading. Here ends the Electronics part of the project.
Next, come the design part and the physical part which needs to show up the value on the OLED Screen on the data glass. The received Bluetooth data is displayed on the OLED display, It's then reflected over the mirror, goes through the lens and you can see the picture in the little transparent acrylic glass. 
In order to reduce the size of the product, it uses Arduino Pro mini as the microcontroller.
This idea of the data glass can further be extended for other applications, like to make the screen of smartwatches with Bluetooth connectivity to be visible on the data glass.
