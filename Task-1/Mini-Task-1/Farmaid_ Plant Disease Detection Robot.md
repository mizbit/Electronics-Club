# Farmaid: Plant Disease Detection Robot 
## Description
Autonomous robot that can move in a farm environment without damaging existing plants or soil and use object detection to find and mark diseased crops with an environmentally safe color. Traditionally, humans have to manually inspect large farms using their phones to mark the crops, in most high tech cases. This takes a lot of time and effort. Additionally, there are a variety of phones being used that don't necessarily have all the features required to do the task efficiently or they have to wait for someone with the proper device. To look at raised beds of plants and potentially upgrade to a moving camera that could look at the top and bottom of tomato plants, it has a camera pole.
The cameras were Raspberry Pi Cameras attached to two different Pis powered by USB chargers. The reason for it to use 2 Pi's is that both classification and navigation use a neural network which takes a lot of processing power. Additionally, the classification camera had to point towards the plants while the navigation camera had to point in front. To drive the robot, it uses an IBT-2 motor controller because the usage of LM298 slows down the robot. For the collision detection, there is an ultrasonic sensor empowered in the front and back of the robot.
For classification it uses the MobileNet SSD model due to its relatively small size. The data is collected as 5-10 second videos and a script is created to extract images from these videos. The videos themselves had been places in folders named after the disease and the plant. These videos are taken under different conditions and at different locations and are given to the model. The total training dataset consisted of about 2000 images.

## Raspberry Pi Camera Module
The Raspberry Pi Camera v2 is a high quality 8 megapixel Sony IMX219 image sensor custom designed add-on board for Raspberry Pi, featuring a fixed focus lens. It's capable of 3280 x 2464 pixel static images, and also supports 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p60/90 video. It attaches to Pi by way of one of the small sockets on the board upper surface and uses the dedicated CSi interface, designed especially for interfacing to cameras. The board itself is tiny, at around 25mm x 23mm x 9mm. It also weighs just over 3g, making it perfect for mobile or other applications where size and weight are important. It connects to Raspberry Pi by way of a short ribbon cable. The high quality Sony IMX219 image sensor itself has a native resolution of 8 megapixel, and has a fixed focus lens on-board. In terms of still images, the camera is capable of 3280 x 2464 pixel static images, and also supports 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p90 video.
## LM298 Motor Driver
The L298 Driver is a high voltage, high current dual full bridge driver designed to accept standard TTL logic levels and drive inductive loads such relays, solenoids, DC and stepping motors. Two enable inputs are provided to enable or disable the device independently of the input signals. The emitters of the lower transistors of each bridge are connected together the corresponding external terminal can be used for the connection of an external sensing resistor.
The L298 integrates two power output stages (A,B). The power output stage is a bridge configuration and its outputs can drive an inductive load in common or differential mode, depending on the state of the inputs. The current that flows through the load comes out from the bridge at the sense output : an external resistor (RSA, RSB.) allows to detect the intensity of this current.
## IBT-2 Motor Driver
The BTS 7960 is part of the NovalithIC family containing three separate chips in one package: One p-channel highside MOSFET and one n-channel lowside MOSFET together with a driver IC, forming a fully integrated high current half-bridge. All three chips are mounted on one common leadframe, using the chip on chip and chip by chip technology. The power switches utilize vertical MOS technologies to ensure optimum on state resistance. Due to the p-channel highside switch the need for a charge pump is eliminated thus minimizing EMI. Interfacing to a microcontroller is made easy by the integrated driver IC which features logic level inputs, diagnosis with current sense, slew rate adjustment, dead time generation and protection against overtemperature, overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent and short circuit. The BTS 7960 can be combined with other BTS 7960 to form H-bridge and 3-phase drive configurations. 
## MobileNet SSD model
Single-shot MultiBox Detector is a one-stage object detection algorithm. This means that, in contrast to two-stage models, SSDs do not need an initial object proposals generation step. This makes it, usually, faster and more efficient than two-stage approaches such as Faster R-CNN, although it sacrifices performance for detection of small objects to gain speed.MobileNets primarily focus on optimizing for latency but also yield small networks. MobileNets are built primarily from depthwise separable convolutions initially introduced in and subsequently used in Inception models to reduce the computation in the first few layers. Flattened networks build a network out of fully factorized convolutions and showed the potential of extremely factorized networks.
