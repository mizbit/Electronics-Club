# Build a LAMP Web Server with WordPress

## Description
The idea of the project is to set up a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on Raspberry Pi and configure it to work as a web server. Further then, install WordPress and set up a basic website that can be accessed on any device on the same network as the RPi.

The Steps involved in this are:

* Set up an Apache webserver to host the web pages that we create. Apache on its own can serve static HTML pages over HTTP. But in order to host dynamic web pages, one needs to use additional scripting languages such as PHP. 

* Install PHP (PHP is a Preprocessor), it’s code run when the server receives a request for a web page via a web browser. Unlike static HTML, PHP can show different content under different circumstances.

* Now we need a database to store all the information that is on the webpage and for that, we use My-SQL (a popular database engine).

* Wordpress must be installed and set up in order to develop web pages. After installation, we need to create a WordPress database with the help of My-SQL. Following it we start to set up our webpage and then design it using the tools in Wordpress. 

Further, we could try out these: 
* Try adding pages and posts to the website.
* Try installing different themes from the Appearance menu.
* Try customising your website’s theme, or creating new themes.
* Try using the webserver to display useful information for people on the same network as that of RPi.
