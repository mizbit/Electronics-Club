# Pac-Man treasure hunt on the terminal (Learning CLI in RPi)

## Description
In this project, the user will be Pac-Man. However, instead of just being a hungry yellow circle, this is also an ethical hacker who should defend the computer from attackers!

This is the situation: there is a huge problem with your computer system — it’s being attacked by nasty viruses. These viruses are the Pac-Man ghosts. The goal is to catch and get rid of all of these ghosts! Once you have caught all the ghosts, you can go about collecting your treasure.

To catch the ghosts, you will need to navigate the maze that is your computer. You can navigate your Raspberry Pi computer by using the command line. 
So, to complete the treasure hunt you must:
* Find the ghosts
* Trap the ghosts
* Collect your treasure

To start the treasure hunt, you will need to download a file that will unleash the Pac-Man ghosts! These aren’t real viruses, the files completely safe and cannot do any damage to your computer. 

Now, comes the gameplay, the player(user here) will have to create a separate folder ( any name, for a sake, let’s keep it ghost) to separate out the ghosts and keep them in it.  For catching the ghost the player has to go to each directory and find if there are any weird looking files ( file name will be a combo of text and number which won’t make any sense) and move them to the separate folder created and delete the file from that directory. 

In this manner, the player should collect all the ghosts and finally should move to the separate directory to get the points. For scoring the player should view the ghost file the score will be displayed in it.

The idea of the game is to make the player more familiar with the Command Line Interface tools in Raspberry Pi.
