# Minutes of Meeting (MoM)                                           
***Date: 16/05/2020 Timing: 9-9:45pm***

This is the second meeting held this year. The Coords and heads were in it and two coords weren't attending.

***Praveen:***

_Responsiblity for MoM's of all project meetings:_

During the tenure of all coords, many project meetings will be held, and so the coords will take the responsiblity of maintaining the minutes. The minutes will include all the points discussed in the meeting and other important decisions taken. This must be held transperant and each coord should maintain all the minutes in a github page.

_Tracking Projects:_ 

Similarly all the coords should maintain a track of all the project work going on. It includes maintaining the timeline and keep track of the progress. There are two options for it, Trello Board and Github Project Page andthe coords shall decide among themselves to keep a common track of it. There are two project tracking mechanisms namely the Internal and External.

Internal : The coords along with the club heads will be tracking all the happenings and the work done along with the deadlines for the next tasks. This is done within the club itself

External : As the name suggest this will include members outside of electronics club too. Suppose if a big problem has been solved that's a part of pipeline of a project, that's a great achievement for the team as well as the club. The same problem might be with the other clubs too, so for that purpose the other teams( project management team of CFI) will be keeping a track of the projects from various clubs. 

***Aswin:***

_Moving to Teams:_ 

Slack Free has many restrictions and hence all clubs are moving to Teams. The other responsiblities of switching from slack to teams including transfering links, sending invitations will be taken up by aswin and will be made ASAP.

_Multi-Club Closed Door session:_ 

Just a Heads up , This is a Pretty New initiative that there is a proposal for Inter-Club communication. Where Coords can present their work on interest and something that they've worked upon during the quarantine etc...

_Suprise:_ 

This is only for the coordinators, all the coords are given a chance to choose a project of their own interest, it can be entirely new or a folow up to an existing project. It will be funded by the club through reimbursement. The coords have to do this during their quarantime time and bring out their project when they return to college. This can be preseted during the multi-club closed sessions and also during the Tech-sphere orientation. A draft regarding the idea, bill of materials, feasiblity, time required ahs to be submitted before 24th May.
