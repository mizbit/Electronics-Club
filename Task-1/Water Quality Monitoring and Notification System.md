# Water Quality Monitoring and Notification System
## Description
This system monitors the Quality of water, interns of monitoring the level of water, the temperature of the water and its surrounding, the turbidity of the water (how clean the water is) as well as the PH levels of the Water and finally when all check has been completed, its sends the information or data as an SMS to notify the authorized personnel.
It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level, temperature sensor to find out the temperature of the water, and it also employs a pH sensor and turbidity sensor to measure the corresponding values. There is also an LCD Display that is used to display the values of temperature, turbidity, and pH in it. To send periodic information to the user, there is a GSM module that does this process of communication. All these are controlled by Arduino which is the microcontroller here.
## Ultrasonic sensor
The ultrasonic sensor also is known as an ultrasonic transducer that is based on a transmitter and receiver and mainly used to determine the distance from the target object.
The amount of time it takes to send and receive waves will determine how far the object is placed from the sensor. It mainly depends on the sound waves working on “non-contact” technology. The required distance of the target object is measured without any damage, giving you accurate and precise details.
This sensor comes with a range between 2cm to 400cm and is used in a wide range of applications including speed and direction measurement, wireless charging, humidifiers, medical ultrasonography, sonar, burglar alarms, and non-destructive testing.
##  Turbidity sensor
One of the preferred methods for turbidity water testing is the use of a nephelometer, or a turbidity meter and probe. A turbidity probe works by sending a light beam into the water to be tested. This light will then be scattered by any suspended particles. A light detector is placed at (usually) a 90-degree angle to the light source and detects the amount of light that is reflected back at it. The amount of light reflected is used to determine the particle density within the water. The more light that is detected, the more particles are present in the water.
## pH sensor
“pH stands for the power of hydrogen, which is a measurement of the hydrogen ion concentration in the body. The total pH scale ranges from 1 to 14, with 7 considered to be neutral. A pH less than 7 is said to be acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic or alkaline.”
An acidic solution has far more positively charged hydrogen ions in it than an alkaline one, so it has greater potential to produce an electric current in a certain situation.in other words, it’s a bit like a battery that can produce a greater voltage. A pH meter takes advantage of this and works like a voltmeter: it measures the voltage (electrical potential) produced by the solution whose acidity we’re interested in, compares it with the voltage of a known solution, and uses the difference in voltage (the “potential difference”) between them to deduce the difference in pH.
##  Temperature sensor
The LM35 is one kind of commonly used temperature sensor that can be used to measure temperature with an electrical o/p comparative to the temperature (in °C). It can measure temperature more correctly compared with a thermistor. This sensor generates a high output voltage than thermocouples and may not need that output voltage to be amplified. The LM35 has an output voltage that is proportional to the Celsius temperature. The scale factor is .01V/°C. The LM35 does not need any exterior calibration and maintains an exactness of +/-0.4°C at room temperature and +/-0.8°C over a range of 0°C to +100°C. One more significant characteristic of this sensor is that it draws just 60 microamps from its supply and acquires a low self-heating capacity. The LM35 temperature sensor available in many different packages like T0-46 metal can transistor-like package, TO-92 plastic transistor-like package, 8-lead surface mount SO-8 small outline package.
